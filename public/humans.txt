/* DESCRIPTION */
    Bleu Chef is a social network base on cooking people's interests and exchanges. 
    It allows everyone to find someone to cook for them or to offer their services as a talented cook.
    It works like the concept of car sharing, replacing the notion of a car with that of a stove.
    Some people love cooking, other love eating. Can we find a match?...
